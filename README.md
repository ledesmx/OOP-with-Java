## Setup and Build

You will need the JDK. I used JDK 21.

You can check the code and explanation of every topic.

### To build and run the code

First clone the repository.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ledesmx/OOP-with-Java
$ cd OOP-with-Java
```

Then, go to the topic of your choice, build it, and run it.
```bash
$ cd 1-introduction  
$ javac Introduction.java && java Introduction
```
